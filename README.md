# Quicksort speed test

This project compares the speed of quicksort between C++ and Java.

Nested into this project are two folder one for the java implementation and one for the c++ implementation. Inside both
folders is a README that will describe how to build these projects and run them.

Both of them will create `csv` files in the folder that the program has been run from. Inside this `csv` file is the time
in nanoseconds that it took for the program to sort the list. Each test will create a `csv` file for each array size. 
The tested array sizes are 100, 1,000, 10,000, 20,000, 40,000, 80,000 100,000, 160,000, and 1,000,000. Each of these tests will be run 1000 times to get an 
average.

## Process script

This folder also contains a process script, this is a python3 script meant to process the `csv` files generated by the \
tests.

Just run the script with each `csv` file as a command line argument
```bash
./process.py 10000.csv 20000.csv 40000.csv
```

The script also supports Unix GLOB's so it's also possible to use `*.csv` to include all `csv` files in a directory.
